# GitHub Status API GUI

The GitHub Status API GUI is a React/Redux client-side web application which can be used to view and create GitHub commit [statuses](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statuses/) in any GitHub repository you have access to. The application uses OAuth to allow users to authenticate to GitHub using their own GitHub usernames and passwords.
